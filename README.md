## Object Orientation Challenge

Exercises involved creating classes then extending the classes into new subclasses.
The benefits of Jasmine were seen as I forgot to return "Vehicle added!" after pushing a new vehicle onto the array in the add method in the Garage class!
All code has Jasmine tests to check the results.

Please go to [jimgeist.github.io/sb_12-01-12_Car_OO_Project](https://jimgeist.github.io/sb_12-01-12_Car_OO_Project/) for the results of the Jasmine tests.
